        "Walter Kaufmann and Alfred Bucherer performed experiments in the early 20th century to determine the effect of electric fields and magnetic fields on moving electrons. In 1901, Kaufmann did an experiment to investigate the effect of changing energy on electrons in the 0.7 MeV to 1.6 MeV energy range. Later, Bucherer did a similar experiment, which included lower energy electrons. Note that Kaufmann took his data before the introduction of the special theory of relativity in 1905. In both cases, the experimenters measured energy by deflecting an electron beam with an electric field while momentum was derived by deflecting the beam with a magnetic field, as seen in [Figure 1](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1BSOCNoXLmHfuN2rczExpGL-cpNqJqxy1)  \n",
